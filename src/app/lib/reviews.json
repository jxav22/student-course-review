The final exam was easy as shit so you should pass easily.",

Also Mohans questions are vague repeats of previous semesters with small twists, if you know whats going on you'll be fine. The first half is super helpful and the assignment is very practical, testing on the first half is simple as . Overall not the easiest course but will put you in good standing in the future."

It contains networking fundamentals, an assignment implementing UDP server and client as well as networking algorithms - all easy as pie. Second half was machine learning.. it was reinforcement learning - it was VERY interesting but mohan expects you to be quite a lot smarter than you are so take care lmao. The final exam was easy as shit so you should pass easily.",
        "To the other guy. if you found it so hard you shouldve gone and talked to the lecturers- they basically spoonfed those that turned up the rough areas they were focusing on that we should study. Also Mohans questions are vague repeats of previous semesters with small twists, if you know whats going on you'll be fine. The first half is super helpful and the assignment is very practical, testing on the first half is simple as . Overall not the easiest course but will put you in good standing in the future."

        "Module 2 was not taught well at all, Bruce was uninspiring and bland. This is the module where you might suffer if you have no interest. The topics revolved around boolean algebra, combinational/sequential circuits, positional numeral systems, and various misc. trivia regarding computer systems.",

The worst thing about this course for us is that the mid-term tests were ridiculously easy, which meant that it was really difficult to gauge how well you actually knew the material, and coming into exam time set in some panic because all of a sudden you feel like you never actually understood anything and you're about to sit something worth 60% of your mark with 0% understanding, though they did also say they would address this next year. I wouldn't say this was my favourite course (I never liked electricity at high school either) but I think it is now MUCH better than the previous reviews make it out to be"

He skips derivation IN THE MIDDLE OF DERIVING IT (op-amp). I heard last year there was a guy called Gerard who taught Bill's topics really well, so I'm sort of jealous at last year's cohort, and at the same time worried that I am starting to lose interest in ELECENG as a subject.

        "This is hands-down the worst paper of Part I Engineering. Almost everything about it was terrible, even giving it 1 star is fucking generous. I expected this to be the worst paper in first-year since I hated electricity in high school physics, however I didn't expect it to be that fucking bad. The first of our two lecturers was William. While I appreciate the amount of time he spends on Piazza trying to help students, I found some of his essays and copypastas really annoying. \"Hope this helps\", more like, yeah nah mate. His lecturing is definitely not for me either, he seems to spend at least 80% of the lecture waffling about absolute nonsense, making me even more confused than I already am with his boring as content. Then we had Bill who is the literal epitome of a man that is just stuck on 0.3x speed irl. When I was watching his lectures on 2x speed, it honestly just seemed like he was still talking at a slower than normal pace. I actually found his content quite interesting, however, he was terrible at explaining the concepts, and like William, seemed to spend most of the lecture talking about useless shit.",
        "I went to a total of 4 lectures in the entire semester. Saying that they were an absolute waste of time would be the biggest understatement of the century. I didn't bother going to or watching William's lectures, for the most part, just copied down the coursebook notes that he posts on CANVAS since they're actually really good. Bill's lectures I actually watched (on 2x speed) since he barely writes any notes. I honestly think that, if the lecturers sped up their pace and cut down on the irrelevant shit they spewed out their mouths, this course could have two lectures a week instead of the dreadful four (two of which being 8AM's, literally why would you do this for the worst and most boring fucking class).",
        "And where do I even begin with the way this course was assessed. \"The assessments were a good reflection of your learning\", yeah fuck right off. The tests should not at all have been multi-choice, imagine losing 2 marks out of 40 for something so stupid like getting your signs mixed up. And holy fuck was that first test terrible, why does William actually write the most asshole questions. On a more positive note, I actually found the assignments to be very helpful, as it allowed me to review the content each week and see which things I needed to work on, and it lowered how much the exam was worth overall.",
        "Oh, the exam. For a cohort that averages mostly B's, B+'s and A-'s in other papers, if the average is a C, maybe it's not because the students didn't know or understand how to apply the concepts they were taught, rather the exam was just an absolute shitshow. The questions were straight-up weird, and at first it seemed like the contents of the exam were never taught to us. However the worst part was the amount of time given to sit the exam, it was not at all doable in 2 hours. Previous years' exams which were 3 hours long seemed to take much less time to do than this one. Thankfully it's only worth 45%, I dread to know what my final grade would be, had this been a 70% exam like chemmat121. I honestly just hope that this course didn't ruin students' GPA enough to prevent them from getting into their first-choice specialisations, but let's be honest, it probably fucking did.",

Udaya was a nice guy with real passion but I found it hard to focus in his class. He tries to say too much which loses people\u2019s attention. William was excellent, he really nailed circuit analysis and his work on the mcqs, piazza and assignments were outstanding. He always answers your questions and makes sure you really get it and independently reach a conclusion. Gerard was Gerard. Consistent, concise, clear. Really made OPAMPS easy to understand when it started to become difficult. Sad to hear this might be his last year of teaching 101, but with William taking over, I\u2019m sure first years will find it a quality course indeed.",

        "As engineers, we generally like our problems to be about problem solving and maths equations. However, we found ourselves having to memorise software development strategies, the sensors and actuators of the curiosity mars rover, various miscellaneous trivia about pace makers and the smart rooms. Now, this wasn't as bad as people make it out to be, but it should be made clearer as to what is examinable and what is not from the START of the course. I did find the summary lecture before the test quite helpful and made this clear, however it was a bit too late by then.",
        "Also, it was difficult for me to take ANYTHING away from the tutorial classes and found all of them to be an utter waste of time. It's a shame that it is the tutorial content that is often examined to reward those who pained themselves to come and strained themselves to stay awake."

        "Module 2 was not taught well at all, Bruce was uninspiring and bland. This is the module where you might suffer if you have no interest. The topics revolved around boolean algebra, combinational/sequential circuits, positional numeral systems, and various misc. trivia regarding computer systems.",
        "Module 3 was the middle ground in terms of teaching quality. I felt Udaya's passion for what he had to talk about (power electronics) and he really did try to teach us the best he could. He brought in examples and real life contraptions that I think would have spiced Module 2 up immensely. Nonetheless, there were times I struggled to understand him due to his accent. I found watching the lecture recordings helpful there as I could slow down and increase the volume.",

        "They had a MAJOR overhaul of this course coming into 2016, so the lecturer that everyone else is complaining about is no longer teaching (Bruce) and his section is split between Udaya (who you can't not like, but can sometimes be a little unclear) and Gerard (who is very well explained but sometimes goes a little bit slow - which he said he had taken on board from the course feedback from this year). The worst thing about this course for us is that the mid-term tests were ridiculously easy, which meant that it was really difficult to gauge how well you actually knew the material, and coming into exam time set in some panic because all of a sudden you feel like you never actually understood anything and you're about to sit something worth 60% of your mark with 0% understanding, though they did also say they would address this next year. I wouldn't say this was my favourite course (I never liked electricity at high school either) but I think it is now MUCH better than the previous reviews make it out to be"

He skips derivation IN THE MIDDLE OF DERIVING IT (op-amp).

William was excellent, he really nailed circuit analysis and his work on the mcqs, piazza and assignments were outstanding. He always answers your questions and makes sure you really get it and independently reach a conclusion. Gerard was Gerard. Consistent, concise, clear.

Sad to hear this might be his last year of teaching 101, but with William taking over, I\u2019m sure first years will find it a quality course indeed.",

        "This is hands-down the worst paper of Part I Engineering. Almost everything about it was terrible, even giving it 1 star is fucking generous. I expected this to be the worst paper in first-year since I hated electricity in high school physics, however I didn't expect it to be that fucking bad. The first of our two lecturers was William. While I appreciate the amount of time he spends on Piazza trying to help students, I found some of his essays and copypastas really annoying. \"Hope this helps\", more like, yeah nah mate. His lecturing is definitely not for me either, he seems to spend at least 80% of the lecture waffling about absolute nonsense, making me even more confused than I already am with his boring as content. Then we had Bill who is the literal epitome of a man that is just stuck on 0.3x speed irl. When I was watching his lectures on 2x speed, it honestly just seemed like he was still talking at a slower than normal pace. I actually found his content quite interesting, however, he was terrible at explaining the concepts, and like William, seemed to spend most of the lecture talking about useless shit.",
        "I went to a total of 4 lectures in the entire semester. Saying that they were an absolute waste of time would be the biggest understatement of the century. I didn't bother going to or watching William's lectures, for the most part, just copied down the coursebook notes that he posts on CANVAS since they're actually really good. Bill's lectures I actually watched (on 2x speed) since he barely writes any notes. I honestly think that, if the lecturers sped up their pace and cut down on the irrelevant shit they spewed out their mouths, this course could have two lectures a week instead of the dreadful four (two of which being 8AM's, literally why would you do this for the worst and most boring fucking class).",
        "And where do I even begin with the way this course was assessed. \"The assessments were a good reflection of your learning\", yeah fuck right off. The tests should not at all have been multi-choice, imagine losing 2 marks out of 40 for something so stupid like getting your signs mixed up. And holy fuck was that first test terrible, why does William actually write the most asshole questions. On a more positive note, I actually found the assignments to be very helpful, as it allowed me to review the content each week and see which things I needed to work on, and it lowered how much the exam was worth overall.",
        "Oh, the exam. For a cohort that averages mostly B's, B+'s and A-'s in other papers, if the average is a C, maybe it's not because the students didn't know or understand how to apply the concepts they were taught, rather the exam was just an absolute shitshow. The questions were straight-up weird, and at first it seemed like the contents of the exam were never taught to us. However the worst part was the amount of time given to sit the exam, it was not at all doable in 2 hours. Previous years' exams which were 3 hours long seemed to take much less time to do than this one. Thankfully it's only worth 45%, I dread to know what my final grade would be, had this been a 70% exam like chemmat121. I honestly just hope that this course didn't ruin students' GPA enough to prevent them from getting into their first-choice specialisations, but let's be honest, it probably fucking did.",

        "This is hands-down the worst paper of Part I Engineering. Almost everything about it was terrible, even giving it 1 star is fucking generous. I expected this to be the worst paper in first-year since I hated electricity in high school physics, however I didn't expect it to be that fucking bad. The first of our two lecturers was William. While I appreciate the amount of time he spends on Piazza trying to help students, I found some of his essays and copypastas really annoying. \"Hope this helps\", more like, yeah nah mate. His lecturing is definitely not for me either, he seems to spend at least 80% of the lecture waffling about absolute nonsense, making me even more confused than I already am with his boring as content. Then we had Bill who is the literal epitome of a man that is just stuck on 0.3x speed irl. When I was watching his lectures on 2x speed, it honestly just seemed like he was still talking at a slower than normal pace. I actually found his content quite interesting, however, he was terrible at explaining the concepts, and like William, seemed to spend most of the lecture talking about useless shit.",
        "I went to a total of 4 lectures in the entire semester. Saying that they were an absolute waste of time would be the biggest understatement of the century. I didn't bother going to or watching William's lectures, for the most part, just copied down the coursebook notes that he posts on CANVAS since they're actually really good. Bill's lectures I actually watched (on 2x speed) since he barely writes any notes. I honestly think that, if the lecturers sped up their pace and cut down on the irrelevant shit they spewed out their mouths, this course could have two lectures a week instead of the dreadful four (two of which being 8AM's, literally why would you do this for the worst and most boring fucking class).",
        "And where do I even begin with the way this course was assessed. \"The assessments were a good reflection of your learning\", yeah fuck right off. The tests should not at all have been multi-choice, imagine losing 2 marks out of 40 for something so stupid like getting your signs mixed up. And holy fuck was that first test terrible, why does William actually write the most asshole questions. On a more positive note, I actually found the assignments to be very helpful, as it allowed me to review the content each week and see which things I needed to work on, and it lowered how much the exam was worth overall.",
        "Oh, the exam. For a cohort that averages mostly B's, B+'s and A-'s in other papers, if the average is a C, maybe it's not because the students didn't know or understand how to apply the concepts they were taught, rather the exam was just an absolute shitshow. The questions were straight-up weird, and at first it seemed like the contents of the exam were never taught to us. However the worst part was the amount of time given to sit the exam, it was not at all doable in 2 hours. Previous years' exams which were 3 hours long seemed to take much less time to do than this one. Thankfully it's only worth 45%, I dread to know what my final grade would be, had this been a 70% exam like chemmat121. I honestly just hope that this course didn't ruin students' GPA enough to prevent them from getting into their first-choice specialisations, but let's be honest, it probably fucking did.",

His delivery may be a little slow, but it adds to the preciseness by which he articulates his points. Bill Collis, on the other end, seems unsure of himself all the time. He skips derivation IN THE MIDDLE OF DERIVING IT (op-amp). I heard last year there was a guy called Gerard who taught Bill's topics really well, so I'm sort of jealous at last year's cohort, and at the same time worried that I am starting to lose interest in ELECENG as a subject. I'm writing this in the mid-sem break, so let's see what happens"

William was excellent, he really nailed circuit analysis and his work on the mcqs, piazza and assignments were outstanding. He always answers your questions and makes sure you really get it and independently reach a conclusion. Gerard was Gerard. Consistent, concise, clear.

The worst thing about this course for us is that the mid-term tests were ridiculously easy, which meant that it was really difficult to gauge how well you actually knew the material, and coming into exam time set in some panic because all of a sudden you feel like you never actually understood anything and you're about to sit something worth 60% of your mark with 0% understanding, though they did also say they would address this next year. I wouldn't say this was my favourite course (I never liked electricity at high school either) but I think it is now MUCH better than the previous reviews make it out to be"

        "I didn't find the course as bad in 2015 as the previous reviews make it out to be, but that may be because I personally found it interesting.",
        "Module 1 was very well taught, and done so by Gerard Rowe (who won the national teaching excellence award in 2004). In my opinion it was the most content-heavy module in the sense that you had to practice lots to get things right. We were given a ton of resource material to practice on.",
        "Module 2 was not taught well at all, Bruce was uninspiring and bland. This is the module where you might suffer if you have no interest. The topics revolved around boolean algebra, combinational/sequential circuits, positional numeral systems, and various misc. trivia regarding computer systems.",
        "Module 3 was the middle ground in terms of teaching quality. I felt Udaya's passion for what he had to talk about (power electronics) and he really did try to teach us the best he could. He brought in examples and real life contraptions that I think would have spiced Module 2 up immensely. Nonetheless, there were times I struggled to understand him due to his accent. I found watching the lecture recordings helpful there as I could slow down and increase the volume.",
        "Labs were great fun.",
        "Overall - an interesting course if you're into this stuff. If you're not, good luck when module 1 is over."

It's easy to get lost in the third section, as the lecturer expects a certain base of knowledge that many of you won't have. I knew a few people who didn't finish the MST. The exam was reasonably challenging, although one of the lecturers pretty much told us what would be in his section. You'll need to use google-fu to teach yourself the concepts if you want a good grade, but our grades were significantly scaled up anyway, so it's possible for someone even with no prior knowledge to get into A / A+ territory. Additionally, the lecturers are friendly and more than happy to help you during their office hours. What is taught in this course is much better learned through practical application, which you'll experience in ELECTENG 209."

They're both very approchable and responsive to questions post-lectures, which is really nice. Probably the most relevant course for compsys students this semester, along with electeng 210. If you enjoy designing digital circuits to solve a variety of problems, this course is for you. This course does move a bit slowly though, but it seems to be because of backlash over complaints from previous years. Not as much emphasis on VDHL or C coding in the exams, which is instead the focus of the labs and assignments.",

I highly recommend referring Vahid's textbook for the first two sections of this course. It's easy to get lost in the third section, as the lecturer expects a certain base of knowledge that many of you won't have. I knew a few people who didn't finish the MST. The exam was reasonably challenging, although one of the lecturers pretty much told us what would be in his section. You'll need to use google-fu to teach yourself the concepts if you want a good grade, but our grades were significantly scaled up anyway, so it's possible for someone even with no prior knowledge to get into A / A+ territory. Additionally, the lecturers are friendly and more than happy to help you during their office hours. What is taught in this course is much better learned through practical application, which you'll experience in ELECTENG 209."

My advice: Get started on assignment 4 as soon as you get it. Once you have done it, you don't need to worry about it, you can just study for the test and focus on 209."

This was the best part of the class. Most *other* lectures consist of lecturers throwing information at students who struggle to absorb the material during class only to figure it out later during self study. In this class, you should leave the lecture feeling you totally have it sorted.",

You cannot afford to have gaps from sem 1 as you actually have to apply these concepts in a project in this course. Tests were also quite difficult . You will spend more time on this course than the other 3 combined so be prepared to live in the UG labs. Its all worth it though. A word of advice: Choose you group members very wisely. If you choose to work with mates that don't have work ethic you will either ruin your grades or have to do 2 or 3 peoples worth of work. If you suck at everything in this course compsys or electrical is probably not for you think about switching."

He opted for handwritten slides instead of powerpoint slides or a digital version of the notes, and these written slides are often very hard to read, and are worded in such a way that make it impossible to understand what they mean without his lecturing context. This makes study for his section of the course very frustrating as it makes watching lecture recordings at some point mandatory, despite having turned up to every single lecture and doing my best to take custom notes for each one. On the other hand, he is a very helpful lecturer who takes time to help those who seek assistance.",

He doesn't seem to care too much about his students, and when emailing him asking for help on a subject, he replies saying he thought he taught that section of the course really well, then doesn't answer the question by sidetracking somewhere else. He also adds to curriculum at his own whim, despite saying particular sections are not examinable, showing that he doesn't prepared the course very well.",

Also no Mark Wilson for our year.",

He has a typical professor style of teaching and some of his explanations were hit or miss, but by second year you really shouldn't be expecting your lecturer to carry you to a good grade. He is also rather unconventional and quite blunt, saying things like 'if you don't understand this, you should drop out', but I do feel like if you look like you're trying to learn the content, he'll be helpful. he takes time-outs to do things like 'all questions asked' where we can ask him about random shit.

The practical tests are placed well so you'll actually get finished by the due date.

        "Compsys version of 209, but on steroids. There is an analogue and digital design part to it so its best to have a really diverse team (pick 2 people who like pcb,electronics stuff and other 2 who wanna code). Our year was especially harder since we didnt have any lectures on digital design (  nadeem resigned from uni). So basically Nitish took the entire course. Lectures are more like informal meetings, only helpful to clarify things about the project. This course literally sucks up all your time so make sure you plan ahead for all the deadlines for the sem. TA's are god, they literally carry. Overall this is your typical design project, you need solid contributions from all members to make this work so think about the team you choose before you pick your team. Design test is hard af so watch out for that.",

Writing assembly wasnt the easiest thing I've ever learnt, but after the first assignment I understood the basics. Don't skip class, Morteza is a fantastic lecturer who's start of class summaries cement last lectures content (meaning you don't have to do much out of class summary/revision). Oliver introduces caches, virtual memory and parallel processing. Some of the concepts require you to think.",

        "First half is learning to write with the MIPS instruction set. Morteza is a little bit tough to follow, but while doing his assignments you'll learn that you have everything available to you. His lecture notes cover most of what you need for the assignments (not quite a walkthrough) and when it comes to his part of the exam you get all the appendices in the world to help you. Datapathing might seem tough at first but I guarantee halfway through your first practice exam it will all click, its really just matching up numbers in the appendices. Most compsys students will find this interesting enough to put some effort in.",
        "The second half was Oliver's part. Oliver was a good refreshing start to the second part of the course, his lecture notes are immaculate and he loves running through tasks in class. He uses LATEX for his tutorial questions and answers so that's how you know he's good. You'll learn about caches, cpu configurations, virtual memory and pages which are all things that should get a budding compsys engineer weak at the knees. His real world examples are good and if you are lucky enough to have the guest lecturer we did you'll have one of the best two hours of your entire degree in this course.",
        "The course's main point is to show why compsys engineers write better code than software engineers. It builds on a lot of previous compsys knowledge, so if you know your basics you will barely have to learn anything. Other students beware this course could be tough depending on how much you know. Also don't listen to Alex you don't really need to pay full attention in Morteza's lectures (you'll probably end up doing your 301 in most of your other part III courses)."

Bernard is a god and he knows what he's talking about; he likes students to understand things on a fundamental level and almost his entire section is based around that, and builds up for the actual control systems/transfer function stuff in the second half. Because of this, the first half might be quite difficult and not make much sense until later on...but by the time you start studying for exams, everything falls into place and the understanding blooms in your mind like a plant you thought was once ugly but is actually an alright looking flower-thing."

IF YOU HAVE A PART 4 STUDENTS, EXCAHNGE STUDENT OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF CODING, consider yourself F***ED because there is no way in hell you can finish this project with a 3 man group since at some point during the half way point of the semester one of you guys have to drop everything and start working on the report/presentation and let me tell you that shit is gonna take a lot of your time. Overall this project was just a coding paper where if you basically don't  have any code working you lose about 40% of your final marks. May the odds be ever in your favour kiddos :D"

The exam had questions as hard as the tests, but with more time pressure. The lecturers were fine. The last third of content is a bit rushed, fitting security and multimedia networking into 4 weeks. I found the material all pretty interesting. If you can find the textbook for free somehow, I would highly recommend reading it; they follow the book quite closely and it is well written."

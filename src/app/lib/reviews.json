If not you'll still do fine, i didn't go to a single lecture and came out ok. The actual content can be interesting at times, however it could do with a bit more actual industry related content and a bit more focus on construction than it currently has, rather then spend half the course going over correct H&S practices like every other  vaguely construction related course at UoA imo. Overall id definately rank this as one of if not the best part IV elective course in civil."

Beware though, Tam isn't the most tech savvy guy and lecture recordings are not at always reliable, and they often contain faults (not recording his voice). It also takes Tam at least a week to upload the recordings, meaning that it is easy to fall behind if you don't make the lecture. Make sure to nag him about this early on otherwise he will continue this and even forget to record (his argument being that students should attend lectures no matter what because its not like some people have jobs and also need to work to be able to afford to even go to uni). Piazza communication was virtually nonexistent, however Tam mentioned that this would change for 2019 onwards with TA's helping out (whole good that does now). A positive perhaps is that the labs and field day that he runs are moderately enjoyable and a refreshing break from lectures.",
        "Doug (lecturer) - takes the transport section of the course. In stark contrast to Tam's notes, Doug's are condensed and follow a structural format. Doug makes its clear what he expects from you and what he wants you to know. He does go off on unnecessary tangents on topics not directly impactful to the subject at hand.",
        "In summary, don't let this course get to you too much, it may make you question your decision to take civil engineering, but if you can get through this joke of a course you can get through anything."

        "If you\u2019re the type of student whose only intention is to do the bare minimum and pass, then Liam is an absolute fiend in the sense that if you expect him to grant leniency on your assessment answers, he will end you with a big fat fail grade. If you\u2019re a student with a poor work ethic, then expect Liam to be your worst nightmare because you will not pass his course. Unfortunately, I am this type of student. I tried to juggle fulltime work alongside a fulltime civil engineering degree because I wanted to get away from a toxic parental home but still get to earn my degree. I sat this paper for the first time in 2016 with twenty hours of study feeling confident that Liam would grant a passing grade by giving pity marks to my working as I had successfully done so with other courses. BIG MISTAKE. I failed miserably. I even tried to pass by claiming aegrotat from the stress nose bleed in the exam. I resat the paper last year in 2017 with 20 hours of study and felt that this time I would at least pass. I even felt confident that I would pass since I had filled in most of the questions in the paper. BIG MISTAKE. I failed again. And now, this year will be my final allowable attempt to pass. I feel like I\u2019m not learning from my mistakes because I\u2019m still working fulltime while studying for this degree and I know that there is a very real chance that I can still fail this course regardless of how much I study. As I\u2019m typing this review under the overdose of Ritalin I just took I truly cannot help but express my desperation in the only way I can think of. I know that if I fail this course again I will be expelled from the engineering degree. Despite the amount of study I am doing, I cannot help but feel that there is still a very strong likelihood I can fail because of how strict the passing criterion for this course is. I realise that I am in this predicament of my own accord. I have only myself to blame for this. At the end of the day, Liam is just truly dedicated to ensuring that none of his students pass without truly understanding the key concepts requisite to any professional engineer; Liam\u2019s commitment to this course is second to none. There is not a professor I have come across in my four years of tertiary education that even comes close to the level of dedication this man has for delivering quality course content. That is why I can only rate this course as being 5/5 overall. My only advice to those of you who can relate to my situation is to NEVER UNDERESTIMATE what it truly takes to pass this course. Study HARD for this course, go to EVERY lecture, pay ATTENTION to everything, and truly COMMIT to this course because failing this course twice is a very real outcome. If you think you can pass this course by doing the bare minimum, you\u2019re on your way to contemplating suicide because that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to be feeling if you end up on your third attempt at this course."

Sadly for us this year the course did not end in week 8 like all other years and we were left with Connor Hayden for the last 6 weeks who took us through the computational modelling part of the course. The computational part was very hard especially with how intense the last week of uni is. This left us with no time to revise. On top of that The first part taught by Tam is very concept heavy and all Tam does is take you through derivations of formulas and goes through very little applications so that when it comes to the test you have zero understanding of how to solve the problems. Don't take this course."

Hayden's bit was ok but still you were thrown in the deep end for the PLAXIS project and it was a struggle! Would not recommend this course unless you really really enjoy geo."

Matthew makes a tonne of mistakes throughout his lectures (as he did with COMPSYS303) and just seems really unsure about the content in general. You will be much better off just looking online at the APIs if you want to learn FreeRTOS. Second part is on Esterel, Statecharts and synccharts. Avinash is a decent lecturer and explains the concepts quite well, but we're left wondering if any of this content is actually useful. Even the course TAs will say Esterel isn't used anymore which is extremely discouraging as a student that is paying to learn it. Your money will be better spent taking a different course."

The final exam was easy as shit so you should pass easily.",

Also Mohans questions are vague repeats of previous semesters with small twists, if you know whats going on you'll be fine. The first half is super helpful and the assignment is very practical, testing on the first half is simple as . Overall not the easiest course but will put you in good standing in the future."

Craig is pretty cool as a lecturer, his lectures mostly provide a high-level overview of the challenges to robot design, but the labs are focussed on ROS, which was covered in the last 20 minutes of the first lecture and never touched in class again. The labs are straightforward but the Turtlebot has many eccentricities, especially when using maps. It is almost impossible to have an accurate map-based operation on the robots with the environment in the lab and the on-board sensors. We were told we would be provided a simulation environment, but this also never came into fruition.  In the end though, the labs were fun.",
        "The main problem comes with how the course is organized. The lab-based assignments only occur in the first 6 weeks, and from then on the course completely changes direction and becomes about matrices and kinematics. The content is very dry, but this would not be a problem if we actually had examples to relate these kinematic concepts to; instead, we spend lecture after lecture on derivations and discussing how to solve a problem instead of doing examples on each topic as we normally do in other courses. The problem sheets did not have any answers released until about Week 11, and when released only contained answers to select questions. The easier questions many times.",

The course covers plenty of maths, and derivations, Matlab might show the result, but it doesn't explain the answer as everything is black boxed into pretty APIs.",

The worst thing about this course for us is that the mid-term tests were ridiculously easy, which meant that it was really difficult to gauge how well you actually knew the material, and coming into exam time set in some panic because all of a sudden you feel like you never actually understood anything and you're about to sit something worth 60% of your mark with 0% understanding, though they did also say they would address this next year.

On the other hand, Bill was perhaps the worst lecturer I've ever had. I don't even know how this guy managed to get a PHD when he teaches poorer than arts students. Honestly, he can't even add one and one together without making a mistake. I would be very happy if he manages to keep the lecture recording recording his working instead of the fucking wooden table.  Get this guy out please."

        "William is a legend. He's straight to the point, derives everything from first principles so that we can also derive everything from the first principles. He answers all the questions. His delivery may be a little slow, but it adds to the preciseness by which he articulates his points. Bill Collis, on the other end, seems unsure of himself all the time. He skips derivation IN THE MIDDLE OF DERIVING IT (op-amp). I heard last year there was a guy called Gerard who taught Bill's topics really well, so I'm sort of jealous at last year's cohort, and at the same time worried that I am starting to lose interest in ELECENG as a subject. I'm writing this in the mid-sem break, so let's see what happens"

        "This is hands-down the worst paper of Part I Engineering. Almost everything about it was terrible, even giving it 1 star is fucking generous. I expected this to be the worst paper in first-year since I hated electricity in high school physics, however I didn't expect it to be that fucking bad. The first of our two lecturers was William. While I appreciate the amount of time he spends on Piazza trying to help students, I found some of his essays and copypastas really annoying. \"Hope this helps\", more like, yeah nah mate. His lecturing is definitely not for me either, he seems to spend at least 80% of the lecture waffling about absolute nonsense, making me even more confused than I already am with his boring as content. Then we had Bill who is the literal epitome of a man that is just stuck on 0.3x speed irl. When I was watching his lectures on 2x speed, it honestly just seemed like he was still talking at a slower than normal pace. I actually found his content quite interesting, however, he was terrible at explaining the concepts, and like William, seemed to spend most of the lecture talking about useless shit.",
        "I went to a total of 4 lectures in the entire semester. Saying that they were an absolute waste of time would be the biggest understatement of the century. I didn't bother going to or watching William's lectures, for the most part, just copied down the coursebook notes that he posts on CANVAS since they're actually really good. Bill's lectures I actually watched (on 2x speed) since he barely writes any notes. I honestly think that, if the lecturers sped up their pace and cut down on the irrelevant shit they spewed out their mouths, this course could have two lectures a week instead of the dreadful four (two of which being 8AM's, literally why would you do this for the worst and most boring fucking class).",
        "And where do I even begin with the way this course was assessed. \"The assessments were a good reflection of your learning\", yeah fuck right off. The tests should not at all have been multi-choice, imagine losing 2 marks out of 40 for something so stupid like getting your signs mixed up. And holy fuck was that first test terrible, why does William actually write the most asshole questions. On a more positive note, I actually found the assignments to be very helpful, as it allowed me to review the content each week and see which things I needed to work on, and it lowered how much the exam was worth overall.",
        "Oh, the exam. For a cohort that averages mostly B's, B+'s and A-'s in other papers, if the average is a C, maybe it's not because the students didn't know or understand how to apply the concepts they were taught, rather the exam was just an absolute shitshow. The questions were straight-up weird, and at first it seemed like the contents of the exam were never taught to us. However the worst part was the amount of time given to sit the exam, it was not at all doable in 2 hours. Previous years' exams which were 3 hours long seemed to take much less time to do than this one. Thankfully it's only worth 45%, I dread to know what my final grade would be, had this been a 70% exam like chemmat121. I honestly just hope that this course didn't ruin students' GPA enough to prevent them from getting into their first-choice specialisations, but let's be honest, it probably fucking did.",

William was excellent, he really nailed circuit analysis and his work on the mcqs, piazza and assignments were outstanding. He always answers your questions and makes sure you really get it and independently reach a conclusion. Gerard was Gerard. Consistent, concise, clear. Really made OPAMPS easy to understand when it started to become difficult. Sad to hear this might be his last year of teaching 101, but with William taking over, I\u2019m sure first years will find it a quality course indeed.",

They're both very approchable and responsive to questions post-lectures, which is really nice. Probably the most relevant course for compsys students this semester, along with electeng 210. If you enjoy designing digital circuits to solve a variety of problems, this course is for you. This course does move a bit slowly though, but it seems to be because of backlash over complaints from previous years. Not as much emphasis on VDHL or C coding in the exams, which is instead the focus of the labs and assignments.",
        "Has a crappy writing assignment at the beginning though, which you won't be prepped a whole lot for. Thankfully it's not worth much but it was still a pain. Very forgettable too so I don't even see the point of having done it."

        "The lectures are sleep-inducing and the last half of this paper will be challenging for those who have little to no computer hardware knowledge. I highly recommend referring Vahid's textbook for the first two sections of this course. It's easy to get lost in the third section, as the lecturer expects a certain base of knowledge that many of you won't have. I knew a few people who didn't finish the MST. The exam was reasonably challenging, although one of the lecturers pretty much told us what would be in his section. You'll need to use google-fu to teach yourself the concepts if you want a good grade, but our grades were significantly scaled up anyway, so it's possible for someone even with no prior knowledge to get into A / A+ territory. Additionally, the lecturers are friendly and more than happy to help you during their office hours. What is taught in this course is much better learned through practical application, which you'll experience in ELECTENG 209."

Make sure you do all of them and yeah they are online tests so you are allowed to used your notes to help do the questions. A VERY helpful tip is before you do the tests (main test not oasis) go and do the past exams because the lecturer has a pattern , he has been taking questions from the exams of previous yeas and putting them in tests, practice them and you might end up doing the same question that you have already done in the actual test. Bets advice i could give is just practice all the problems you can get yours hands on and attend the extra tutorials."

        "This course pretty much takes up most of your time in semester 2. There are a lot of content to cover and you have to try and understand them relatively quickly as they get assessed very week or so in the labs. Personally I think most of the learning will happen in the labs and not at the lectures but you should still attend lectures if you can. At the start of the project the best thing to do is to decide if you want to be involved with either digital or analogue then go from there and allocate those works to your teammates. At the end of the semester pretty much every group will most likely finish their project because there are a lot of opportunities to get help ( you just have to be willing to ask), what determines your enjoyment of this project will largely be your team. It sounds over-used but this is true, team work is really important in this project because of the huge work load, find people that are willing to do work and that you would enjoy working with , communicate well and ask for help whenever you're stuck and you will be fine."

He opted for handwritten slides instead of powerpoint slides or a digital version of the notes, and these written slides are often very hard to read, and are worded in such a way that make it impossible to understand what they mean without his lecturing context. This makes study for his section of the course very frustrating as it makes watching lecture recordings at some point mandatory, despite having turned up to every single lecture and doing my best to take custom notes for each one. On the other hand, he is a very helpful lecturer who takes time to help those who seek assistance.",

He doesn't seem to care too much about his students, and when emailing him asking for help on a subject, he replies saying he thought he taught that section of the course really well, then doesn't answer the question by sidetracking somewhere else.

Also no Mark Wilson for our year.",

He has a typical professor style of teaching and some of his explanations were hit or miss, but by second year you really shouldn't be expecting your lecturer to carry you to a good grade. He is also rather unconventional and quite blunt, saying things like 'if you don't understand this, you should drop out', but I do feel like if you look like you're trying to learn the content, he'll be helpful. he takes time-outs to do things like 'all questions asked' where we can ask him about random shit.

The practical tests are placed well so you'll actually get finished by the due date. Hardware wise make sure your circuit is solid, expect to spend hours on your belly on the floor of the ACL labs scoping, but boy will it be worth it come implementation time."

        "Compsys version of 209, but on steroids. There is an analogue and digital design part to it so its best to have a really diverse team (pick 2 people who like pcb,electronics stuff and other 2 who wanna code). Our year was especially harder since we didnt have any lectures on digital design (  nadeem resigned from uni). So basically Nitish took the entire course. Lectures are more like informal meetings, only helpful to clarify things about the project. This course literally sucks up all your time so make sure you plan ahead for all the deadlines for the sem. TA's are god, they literally carry. Overall this is your typical design project, you need solid contributions from all members to make this work so think about the team you choose before you pick your team. Design test is hard af so watch out for that.",

You'll learn about caches, cpu configurations, virtual memory and pages which are all things that should get a budding compsys engineer weak at the knees. His real world examples are good and if you are lucky enough to have the guest lecturer we did you'll have one of the best two hours of your entire degree in this course.",

It builds on a lot of previous compsys knowledge, so if you know your basics you will barely have to learn anything. Other students beware this course could be tough depending on how much you know. Also don't listen to Alex you don't really need to pay full attention in Morteza's lectures (you'll probably end up doing your 301 in most of your other part III courses)."

        "One of those courses that arnt a big pain to deal with. I liked both lecturers. Dariusz generally made a point of starting a lecture by reviewing the previous lectures material which was helpful. His notes were all you needed to get a decent mark. Michael taught us how to do smith charts step by step which was VERY helpful and made what could have been very daunting material very simple. The only comments I could fairly say is that the overall material  was a bit on the dry side BUT BUT this is the elective to take if you want to do a fair amount of work and still get an ok mark such as a B+ or a B and you can't possibly fail this paper unless you have done no work whatsoever. So yeah take this course and avoid those difficult compsys electives!"

TBH this is just a COMPSYS paper don't even try to disguise it as a ELECTENG paper. All I've learnt is that linear compressor will start to move if you're GOOD at coding because despite being able to design a perfect circuit and you can't code for shit consider buying yourself a coffin for your GPA. IF YOU HAVE A PART 4 STUDENTS, EXCAHNGE STUDENT OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF CODING, consider yourself F***ED because there is no way in hell you can finish this project with a 3 man group since at some point during the half way point of the semester one of you guys have to drop everything and start working on the report/presentation and let me tell you that shit is gonna take a lot of your time. Overall this project was just a coding paper where if you basically don't  have any code working you lose about 40% of your final marks. May the odds be ever in your favour kiddos :D"

        "Whoever coordinates this embarrassment to the academic world should be repeatedly shanked with a popsicle stick truss.  The lectures are roughly as much use as smacking you head against the badly laid out coursebook in an attempt to learn by osmosis.  Stephen is exceedingly good at repeating the same basic facts many, many times over.  Hugh spends entire lectures showing you pictures of brackets and fixing completely irrelevant to the course and Pierre is an arrogant, unhelpful and blatantly rude individual.  Don't bother asking a question on the forum, you will most likely be told you should know the answer to your question or that your name has not been included in your enquiry on a supposedly \"anonymous\" forum.  Save yourself the time and only go to the first lecture and the ones on the truss project.  You may consider attending the ones where Hugh demonstrates the use of PTC Creo, don't.  I leaned more about Creo from a silent youtube video than all the lectures put together.  By this time you will have been exposed to the 115 markers.  They are an incompetent group of buffoons who would be better off chasing after bananas like the badly trained apes they are.  The word \"inconsistent\" is something that will often come to mind throughout this course.  Nobody knows what's going on, not the tutors, lectures or the course coordinator, it's an embarrassment to what is widely considered the best engineering school in the country.  I read the reviews of this course before taking it and I remember thinking surely it can't be that bad?  It is.  From what I've heard is't actually better than it used to be.  It's such a shame because this course has the potential to be quite interesting and enjoyable, the Incompetent tools that run it spoil all the fun.  I'm really struggling to express just how badly organised this course is.  If I'm completely honest the best part about this course is Stephen's section, the drawing, after that its a long and lonely road down the toilet.  Have a nice Day."

Drawing is kind of one of those things which you either get or you don\u2019t, and it can\u2019t really be taught so going to the lectures is a complete waste of time. Then we have CAD and more detailed drawings which is taught by Eva. You honestly have to teach yourself how to do use autodesk inventor as the lectures are full of Eva bragging about how she is the fastest female electric motorbike rider or some shit. Then it\u2019s tumanukos section about presentation skills. The funniest thing is that he goes on about how to be a good public speaker yet he is absolutely horse shit at public speaking. Charlotte teaches the truss section after this, she\u2019s an okay lecturer but it\u2019s still not worth going to. This is also the start of the group projects. You get put in groups of 4-5 people from your tutorial and do 2 design projects with them. If you get a shit group you\u2019re out of luck because everyone gets the same grade, and you all rate each others participation so if your group thinks you didn\u2019t participate you get less than the group grade. If you did everything for your group and they all did fuck all, you can only get a maximum of the groups grade, no higher. Also, don\u2019t bother going to the tutorials, none of the tutors can speak English well enough to be able to ask them any questions"

The lecturers made the course boring and uninformative, they didn't explain things effectively or gives us clear targets for the projects.

        "Third of all, the coursebooks have almost no information with regards to their assignments (apart from the first two drawing assignments, worth 15%), resulting in a lot of confusion, and lack of information when completing the bigger assignments, such as the truss project and the Creo project.",

        "this course has a lot of bad reviews and I was real scared going in but they revamped the course for our year and I think made a bunch of improvements because I really enjoyed this course. The projects were often around the same time as tests and go right up to exams which is annoying because they require a LOT of time (more than you think) so I found it really hard to keep up with my other courses and ended up not studying for 121 lol. rip. We didnt use creo this year which probably made a big difference because ive heard its absolute aids. We used autodesk inventor (cant be run on mac so prepare for that) which seemed alg to use once youve had a bit of practice (I recommend running the tutorials built into the software). Design project 1 was a piece of piss compared to the others - you get heaps of time for not much work and you can just rush the workbook like 5 mins before your tutorial. Design project 2 and 3 were alg but it really depends on how motivated your group members are. Another issue is group members who dont speak much english because for both you have to write reports and DP2 requires an oral presentation. Building trusses would have been way more fun if we had more time, definitely the hardest project but my opinion most enjoyable. Hazims lectures on drawing were pretty fun and eva's were interesting but the rest were boring asf and not worth turning up for an 8am lecture. Goodluck.",

Looking over at past exams i saw a question where it asked about the hardest part of the creo course, i thought wow they give out free marks? nope. apparently the thing YOU found the hardest was not the right answer. nice.

        "Enggen115 is an intersting course it is definitely the most hands on 1st engineering course and can be enjoyable because of this the group work projects are really a mixed bag can be heaps of fun if you end up in a group of people who want to actually pass, and are willing to do work to do so, the amount of time that you will end up putting into your creo project is cray, you really don't know what pain is until you've stayed up for 3 nights straight trying to figure how the fuck a swept blend while cutting yourself for choosing to design a working radio or something equally stupid just to end up with the same mark as some kid who modelled a pair of safety scissors, the lectures will never cease to amaze you with their lack of knowledge in a course they taught and been ridiculed on for the last 5 years. The 115 exam really embodies the essences of the 115 course, every year the lectures take 4 slides at random mentioned in through the year from lectures that nobody goes to, writes up a question based on it and takes away three marks from every student that can be bother going through trying to listen to them yarn on about what bullshit they decide to pull out their ass that year, examples of this include questions based on a ted talks video shown, and the 7 qualities a good team member possesses, its just a way to punish the general population who would rather neck themselves than listen to hugh morris or stephen whatever drone on with about as much enthusiasm as someone on death row. the exam is worth 40 marks but theres a rule that the maximum mark for the course you can get is 3x your exam mark out of 40 e.g. 20/40 = 60% so even if you get a+ again just another way to punish those of us with a sense of boredom.

        "The course itself isn't too hard. What makes this a horrible course is the seemingly unnecessary lectures (some of them were good however) and the way group projects were conducted. For both of my group projects, groups were randomly selected by our tutor without concern for the marks of the students. This means that some groups struggled because all of the members were weak at 115, while others had one person who did the whole entire project and were rewarded top marks. It's an unjust system. On the other hand, the tutors and tutorial groups are real fun, some good mates made through the tutorials."

        "So despite all the bad comments on this course, and I do agree that the lectures are completely useless and I have probably only attended 5 overall, I found the tutorials good to make friends, and the projects are manageable too. The course outline for 2017 has been changed from the past years, I believe that the CREO project was worth less than other past years, so was slightly easier in that aspect. It really depends how lucky you are with group members for the 2 team projects that you do, I had good members, but some of my friends definitely struggled and had to do most of the work. The drawings seem hard at first if you have no background in graphics, but with enough practise, they are doable. Definitely don't waste time going to lectures if you think they are useless, which they are, but double check on the slides in case you missed some random info about assignments, or ask friends who do go ;) Final exam is definitely the easiest out of all the other papers- so long as you can draw lol."

P.S.

Lots of times, it's like you are out there, especially in the 3D-modelling project, relying on your friends' help or on your own.",

The material taught in the systems engineering portion was so new that I could not find any good books on it anywhere, and had to rely on the lectures. Maybe they are nudging students to be more independent while working with problems no one else has handled before? Overall, the course was ok, but still has a lot of potential and could use a restructure."

Jason covered the statics content in a manner that was easy to understand, despite our ridiculously hard statics test. Hazim also covered the dynamics content very well and he was very approachable and answered the questions very well when you needed help with particular questions. Karl was also super nice and very helpful as well. The dynamics content was definitely harder than statics but keeping up with the problem sheets and doing the past papers (and just doing as many problems in general) was enough preparation for the exams. Overall, although this was the hardest course, it was probably my favorite because of the lecturers as they genuinely wanted to help their students do well in the course. Only course to have 2 clinics in preparation for the exams as well!"

Jason is my favourite lecturer, make sure to turn up to all his lectures as he gives hints to what will/wont be in the exam. Statics is much easier than dynamics but when you get a force systems questions with 3 unknowns, and 1 of them being an angle, it'll be more tricky than anything in dynamics. my tips, don't bother learning method of joints for trusses (use method of sections), relative motion in dynamics is the hardest question so study well for it, and be comfortable with the new angular formulas/ converting degrees to radians and all that stuff. if you study hard you'll easily pass no question."

This is different to the sucky dynamics notes that Hazim inherited from the previous lecturer so going to lectures is a must. I found Jason to be better at teaching than Hazim, although some of my friends would disagree. Don't feel disheartened if you get the assignments wrong, no one gives a crap after the first 2, and it doesn't count for anything. Definitely do lots of practise and keep up with the coursework!"

I was split between hating that she talked to the slides, and being thankful for it, since I could read the slides and then it didn't matter that I couldn't understand her accent. There were lots of phase diagrams and formulas that came out of nowhere and didn't connect well in my mind. For someone who didn't do chemistry previously, I found this section incomprehensible. NB: I did learn phase diagrams with Bryony in CHEMMAT121 in Semester 2, and realised how easy they actually were. I think it was just taught badly in semester 1.",

For me not having done much with that, I found the speed pretty breakneck. Oh, and one lecture he spends 30 minutes showing a stream of pictures and videos of bones breaking. That was stomach churning to say the least. And the pleasure he was getting out of grossing everyone out. Sick ****. ;)",

It had the potential to be pretty dry ;) stuff, but she was a good lecturer and made it all fit together. This section is really the only reason why Biochem doesn't get a 1 star rating.",
        "Overall a strange course. Very disjointed. For anyone who had done biology and chemistry in school, there would've been nothing new to learn there, and for those who didn't, it was a poor introduction to the disciplines. Months after finishing it, I still don't understand what its goals were with regard to how it helps foster a general engineering base knowledge before going into specialisations in Part II. My understanding is that it's one of the two Part I courses under faculty review. I sure hope they improve it."

        "This course was not extremely difficult but some parts (particularly cellular biosystems and ecology and abit of biomechanics) were boring so it was difficult to gauge any interest in them, hence became quite difficult to study for. Despite what they say about not needing to know any bio or chem from high school, i found that having that prior knowledge would be extremely useful; especially year 12 bio in the cellular bio-systems and biomechanics apparently. I hadn't done bio since year 10 so I was constantly harassing my friends who did bio in school. Ashton's cool and his topic was easy to understand (if you know chemistry). David Long was boring because the cell stuff was boring (but he was really helpful when you needed clarification). Thor went super quick so quite difficult to follow the biomechanics section but he was interesting. Irina was the best! Super helpful, Super interesting and Super nice as well. She was always eager to answer your questions and was honestly the only lecturer who would answer all the water questions on Piazza."

I really didnt like oliver as a lecturer because I just felt like he wasnt teaching us anything for the exam but just trust him and stick with it because his part of the exam was pretty easy if you just study the worksheets he made us do in the last 2 weeks. The 140 report was a mission. Before deciding on a topic do some research and see how hard its going to be to find data because I did my report on sea levels rising and it was really hard to find specific land area numbers etc. In hindsight I should have considered the other topics before choosing that one because it seemed more 'interesting'. I ended up getting A+ for the report but I would say it took longer than the recommended 20 hours. The coursebook was pretty good and the content wasnt that hard, definitely one of the easier papers in semester 1."

I never got the feeling that the course coordinator (David Framil-Carpeno) actually cared, he seemed a bit fed up with us most of the time, but he did his job. Ashton never seemed to want to be there, I don't agree with some of his views, and he just read from the book. Thor was engaging, and both Irina and David ( Long) explained their content clearly. The environment woman needs to learn how to use the microphone/volume settings, it was hard to hear and I was seated around the middle.

The marking was also bad as each section was out of 2 so you can get 0, half or full marks for it with no inbetweens. The tutorials are done by students who either do not understand our content or cannot comminucate it and often just end up repeating themselves but unable to explain. The exam was also badly made as you had only 1 test done in the beginning to base what kind of setout it was due to the course being revised every year so past papers aren't as useful."

        "I just finished this course and I have nothing better to do with my break so this is going to be a pretty comprehensive review.",
        "First I'll cover workload/difficulty. This course is for conjoint students and combines ENGGEN 121 and ENGSCI 111. Because of this, all the content is covered a lot quicker. In this course, you have four lectures per week (two on 121 content, two for 111 content) plus a clinic session. A clinic is basically where you can sit in a common study space and work on problems while the lecturer wanders around in case you have questions or anything. I only went to one of these because the study spaces are pretty crowded and also because I felt weird working on problems in such a 'public' place (idk why). These basically stopped around halfway through the semester though because the turnout was too low. If you were to take the 121 and 111 courses separately, you would have 3 lectures per week for each plus tutorial(s) (not sure how many tutorials). A tutorial is similar to a clinic except it is smaller and they are kind of 'more compulsory' and a bit more structured. Plus a tutor (not the lecturer) takes them. I was quite worried about whether or not I would be able to keep up with the accelerated pace but it is not too bad. They ease you in gently and the first week or two is pretty much just refreshing your memory of high school physics and math. BEWARE though: uni goes from 0-100 real quick and you really, really need to stay on top of things or you can fall behind very quickly. This advice comes from experience. I personally found the mathematics or 111 part of the course decent/manageable. As someone mentioned already, vectors and matrices may be a bit tricky if you haven't encountered them before but I had done Cambridge so I found it all right. Also, the Practice Problems coursebook is really really helpful. They have problems (and, even better, solutions!) organised by topic and they are usually of similar difficulty to what you would be expected to do in assessments. I would recommend you complete the appropriate section of this coursebook as you cover them in lectures, just to practise and understand the concept. Now, where everything went to custard for me was the mechanics or 121 stuff. It starts off okay but then I kind of stopped doing the practice problems at the end of each section because I got it when the lecturer explained the examples, plus motivation kind of dropped off, plus I had work from courses as well etc etc. DO NOT DO THIS! Keep up with the content! I was left trying to catch up on like four weeks worth of stuff the week before the final exam. Needless to say, this did not go too well. The statics section of mechanics is easier than dynamics for most people (including me) because it is the first section taught and also everything pretty much just adds to zero. Dynamics is a step up from the NCEA Level 3 Physics Mechanics topic. So, overall, while it is an accelerated course, I think it is manageable provided you keep up with the content as it's being taught. Also, I found the 111 stuff easier than the 121 stuff. I did occasionally regret choosing a conjoint program and having to take the combined course but looking back on it now, I'm not sure if I would have done (much) better in the two separate courses. I guess we'll see once exam results come out.",
        "Okay, next I'll talk a bit about the lecturers. For the 111 content, we had David Dempsey and Colin Simpson. Colin was a good, really approachable lecturer. David was outstanding and personally my favourite lecturer of the course and possibly the whole semester. David has lecture breaks where he asks trivia questions and awards chocolate for the person with the right answer (possible motivation to attend lectures?). This was great for obvious reasons. I found that both of them explained things well. For the 121 content we had Jason for statics and Karl for dynamics. Jason does have a kind of straightforward, sometimes condescending teaching style which some people seemed to like but which I personally did not enjoy. I didn't find him very approachable but I appreciate that he came in a bit earlier to answer questions we might have. A lot of other students made use of this. Karl used a flipped lecture method where basically he posted videos for us to watch before the timetabled lecture (these lectures explained the concepts) and then during the lecture, he would go through relevant examples. This was a pretty good idea especially given the time constraints of this course but of course sometimes myself and others would forget to watch the videos beforehand. Karl was very approachable. Overall, good to average lecturing with one stand-out. Also, you should have access to the lecture recordings from the separate 111 and 121 course so it might be helpful watch those if you want more explanation or prefer a different lecturer's teaching style.",
        "I guess the last part to cover is the assessment. The exam at the end of semester makes up the bulk of your grade and is weighted at 60% so it's pretty important you prepare well for this. Half the exam is mathematics and half is mechanics. I was confident with the mathematics part of it but kind of shaky on the other half. I got the general feeling most people felt they did stronger in the mathematics, just because of the nature of the mechanics questions this semester. Throughout the semester, you also have a statics test worth 10%, a dynamics test worth 10%. and two mathematics tests worth 7% each. Because these tests are smaller, there's less pressure and I found them manageable. The remaining 6% comes from 9 mathematics assignments. At the end of each module, you get an assignment sheet, answer the questions, and then submit your answers through the online quiz. Someone else noted that because you only give your final answers in the quiz, there's little leeway and you don't get marks for working. So, I guess check your work and answers before submitting the assignment. You aren't allowed calculators during the maths tests so try not to verify basic arithmetic with it. For mechanics, you are allowed approved, restricted calculators.",
        "Whew, finally made it! I hope you found that helpful (hopefully not too overwhelming or confusing). One random thing I liked about this course is the small cohort  that take it. Someone else talked about this on this page already and I would definitely have to agree. It will probably be your smallest class and it's a nice break from those other lectures filled with hundreds of other people.",

David, Jon, and Jason were probably the best semester one lecturers you could ask for, so much regret for skipping those classes, this class is top notch and well taught, however as stated before you should be attending nearly every single class if you want a decent grade in this course. Too bad Jon Pearce is departing from UOA, he's a legend, an angel, god's gift to UOA engineering students.",

        "20% of your final mark for \"participation\" (read: attendance, just renamed so they can get away with it) is a joke. Rob is a knob, he doesn't really care and I don't really give a damn about his opinions which aren't relevant to the course. Fix those two things and you'd have 5 stars for enjoyment and overall. The lectures themselves are alright, but a little slow and the attendance makes it stupid. Make the lectures more engaging by fixing the problem (slow, not much content each time, some average lecturers), ditch attendance, and you'd get 4 stars or more for lecture quality. I do like quizzes in class for helping engagement, but they should be there for being interesting, not just a means for registering attendance. They had an awesome guest lecturer who did the 2012 London Olympics construction, he now works at UoA I believe - get him to take over from Rob and do more stuff, he's good.",
        "Tutorials were okay, generally good tutors from what I've heard from other students. I had Jim, who's awesome. Systems week was fun, just make sure your lazy team members don't let it all fall apart and screw up the content you have prepared.",
        "Reflection on Learnings are a bit pointless. I think they're good for students to do to recap what they've learned (and you'll find you learn a lot more when you have to write about it), but I don't think they should be assessed and graded. Encourage students to write them, don't force them.",
        "Final marks can be redistrubuted. Ditch attendance and RoLs, and maybe put those marks more into the individual assignments, and also the tutorial group assignments (which are currently worth a whopping 0%)."

        "That is fine until you have lectures which basically tell you a concept and you are like cool okay, doable and then in the lab they make it ultra fking hard, they literally say theres an ocean full of sharks, we just taught you how to swim in theory, good luck and they DONT PUSH YOU BUT THROW YOU OFF THE CLIFF. LIKE WTF, their lab session is on Wednesday morning you have no spare time to read the mannual instructions due to the staggering amount of shit you have to do for small quizzes and they only help you on the day the lab is released after that you get 0 help maybe from piazza where half of it useless. I had no time to read most of the lab instructions because I was too tired from the other courses because the content is hitting me like a truck or just trying to finish the previous lab BECAUSE ITS SO DAMN FKING HARD.",
        "One of the labs was PLU factorisation, David gave us a video from the previous years, where he screwed up and he was like hmmm idk what I am doing and proceeds to carry on like nothing happened. So we got 0 information on what we are meant to do. OMG and cloning gits and installing conda 233, do not get me started on that shit, it is tilting asf. My computer could not clone idk why I asked the lecturers and they were like well too bad i guess gotta toughen up.. Dude you are one fking emotionless robot. The labs take FOREVER unless you are gifted at coding they also tell you to learn new shit on stack overflow in the lab instructions. Did I mention that you get marked on efficiency as well although it is not on the rubic. -_- Oh yeah and you have at least an extra assignment from one of your courses or a test every fking week. HECK I had 3 tests in one week. My daily was 3 quizzes, 1 normal lab, THIS FKING LAB and a staggering 16 lectures to watch + INSERT ASSIGNMENT OR TEST. I had to sacrifice labs to do well in the other test unless I had to consume 20 red bulls. But then BIOSCI was like during this pandemic the labs are too easy you know what we are going to make it harder. My lyfe crumbled as I read that e-mail...",
        "David is an absolute troll and heartless fker. Engineering is notorious for using weird english and although he is white, my dear god. I could not understand what 2 of the questions meant in a test on his section. I asked him and he said its up to you, 'We assess your interpretation.' HA cool I am literally reading a foreign language here but ok I will give it my best shot, do you mean this? Then they are like well it did not match with our interpretation and they cuck you, they do not have the brains to even consider how you interpreted it. Oh yeah and he forgot that one of the lecture recordings he uploaded was a duplicate. So when I did the quiz and I saw new stuff, I did not know what to do. He ONLY noticed it until Monday morning where he re-uploaded a new lecture recording. An absolute dick. Oh yeah for the project you barely get 2 weeks... Like wtf I need a break and engsci233 is like, NOP get used to it engineer. You get no life, we are training you to become a workaholic.",
        "Honestly my advice is to pass this course, it is not worth the time and effort for the marks you get.",
        "I actually prayed that David would get corona and die painfully so many times. All in all, if you want to do well in this course be prepared to die or sacrifice your other courses. OR be a social freak and become friends with the gods who sit in the front of the class (who normally do not help) and pray that you get some help, I mean smart guys (sorry but most of the girls does not even look close to girls) literally would not help you unless you are a chick (LOL).",
        "This course is poorly structured, poorly taught, harsh asf markings and little to no help. Just pray and hope you get 2/6 in every lab at least and pass the tests so you have some leeway to ditch certain labs when you need it. Send my regards to this arrogant asf course co-ordinator that I would slit his throat if I see him. I pray you survive through this course comrade and I will see you in other courses."

The extension section consists of two 3% assignments and a 4% test covering data analytics topics learnt in a few lectures. The assignments mostly involved coding in R, using various techniques such as random forests, classification trees, clustering, etc. Test was kinda weird cause it was the first time having one and we weren't given any practice questions or tests to let us know what to expect. The extension content was pretty interesting and apparently may find its way into the main course in 2019."

This project involved a peer review, a written proposal, coded model, and presentation as the group assessment (worth around 15% total). It also had a 12% individual report component. Splitting the group project up into an individual and group section was really good, and I think it may have helped with group participation. Second project was much the same, except a smaller time frame and no presentation. Both projects were really well planned and involved a lot of python programming. I probably spent around 25-30 hours on the first and 15-20 on the second.",

Definitely a solid learning experience that requires good time management throughout the semester to avoid spending your entire mid sem break in 70. Project B involved using SolidWorks to model your Project A device and VBA to change your SolidWorks parts. Marking of the reports was extremely lenient so just make sure to have all the sections they ask for eg discussion of sample results. Pretty cool to see the interaction between CAD and code too.",

The CM section was pretty much rote-learning derivations - I found this section extremely boring and tedious. It was assessed by literally just copying out derivations you had done in class. Uncertainty and Calibration was interesting and a lot of it was common sense stats stuff. It had non-graded labs associated with it, but the stuff you learnt in it came up in the exam so I'd recommend to actually complete them throughout the semester when you can get easily get help.",

Fortunately, everyone does the low workload paper ENGGEN 204 in the same semester which means its manageable.

        "ENGSCI 391 was taught by two lecturers this year: Caroline Jagtenberg and Golbon Zakeri; Caroline was new and, as such, sometimes difficult to follow because of her lack of familiarity with our baseline understanding of the required mathematical notation. Golbon was more familiar with what we could or could not parse with respect to notation, and was relatively easier to learn from. Both lecturers were reliant on slides and I felt that, because of this, some of the content vital to answering exam/test questions felt omitted or very opaque/obscure, especially for those who entered indirectly from engineering and science (i.e. those not from Engineering Science or who had not taken ENGSCI 255/STATS 255).",
        "Linear programming (revised and dual simplex method) dominated most of the course, and was taught jointly by Caroline in Weeks 1\u20134 and Golbon to completion. Probably the hardest section to begin from, especially if the concept of linear programming is new to one. However, the entry requirements assume you have taken at least a first-year linear algebra course, so generalising linear programs to matrices and vectors should be easy to catch on to with practice.",
        "Networks (network simplex method) was second and wholly taught by Golbon. Quite a good section and an intuitive progression from the revised simplex method, which was great.",
        "The final module, integer programming, was shoehorned in at the last minute, and taught alongside pre-written notes. Golbon taught this section as well, taking over from Andrew Mason. Understanding this section was very contingent on whether or not you could make the lectures, as lecture recordings did tend to be uploaded a week after.",
        "All sections were generally very temperamental and reliant on sticking it out until the end, as you were drip-fed knowledge and made to think. Draw your own conclusions as to whether or not this is good pedagogy. However, I felt there needs to be more support in the form of past test and exam answers that would give a clearer picture of the required approaches to assessment, and that lectures didn't feel so rote-taught. Someone like Kevin Jia springs to mind as someone who is a wonderful applied mathematics teacher (see ENGSCI 211).",
        "Programming assignments in MATLAB (one on linear programming and the other on networks) were carried through year-by-year with same questions, so one might call into question the integrity of internal assessment in the course and dodgy mean scores. Tests were hastily done, and one test (Test 2) had misprints/omissions; very disorganised.",

Assignments need to be more fair, especially as the questions each year thus far have come from 2013's cohort (dodgy!) and can worked on between students from all years. Plussage is offered in this course, which is nice, but the tests were way too disorganised to rely on for marks. Insufficient time as well.

In comparison to 2nd year I think Lihua has definitely improved his English and in my opinion if you focus in the lectures he isnt as bad as everyone makes him out to be and whatever he lacks in lecturing abilities he makes up for in his notes which are written out in full with accompanying examples."

Not only does it bring the class average down, but your own average suffers greatly from it. I also think the coursebooks are less than stellar, and provide very little aid when it comes to studying. On a lighter note, there are many resources provided in a clear format on Cecil, making it a very handy study tool, and the lecturers do their best to ensure that everyone is learning at the same pace (though not always with the same level of understanding)."
